## Summary

No access control mechanism for [oTAP.brokerClaim()#L126](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/oTAP.sol#L126)

## Severity

Medium

## Proof of Concept 

oTAP.brokerClaim does not have onlyOwner modifier.
It means anyone can become broker for the oTAP.
A Hacker can frontrun `brokerClaim` tx to become broker of oTAP.

```solidity
    /// @notice tOB claim
    function brokerClaim() external {
        require(broker == address(0), "OTAP: only once");
        broker = msg.sender;
    }
```

## Recommendation

1) It should inherit `BoringOwneable` and its `constructor` should set `msg.sender` as admin.
2) `onlyOwner` modifier should be added for [oTAP.brokerClaim()#L126](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/oTAP.sol#L126)

```solidity
- contract OTAP is ERC721, ERC721Permit, BaseBoringBatchable {
+ contract OTAP is ERC721, ERC721Permit, BaseBoringBatchable, BoringOwnable {
+    constructor() {
+        transferOwnership(msg.sender);
+    }
```
```solidity
-    function brokerClaim() external {
+    function brokerClaim() onlyOwner external {
```
